# RC4 Cryptography

This is a repository for my RC4 cryptography projects, specifically for exercises related to implementing the RC4 encryption and decryption algorithms.

## Code Commits

I will aim to commit code weekly, time permitting, to keep track of my progress in the subject.

## Repository Structure

This directory contains all of my RC4 cryptography projects. It is divided into two subdirectories: `rc4_python` and `rc4_C`, respectively. Each subdirectory contains my implementations of the RC4 encryption and decryption algorithms in Python and C, respectively. 

### RC4 in Python

The `rc4_python` subdirectory contains two directories: `from-scratch` and `production`. The `from-scratch` directory contains my own attempts to implement the RC4 encryption and decryption algorithms from scratch with the help of ChatGPT, while the `production` directory contains a production-grade implementation of the algorithms using the `cryptography` library. 

### RC4 in C

The `rc4_C` subdirectory is similarly structured, with `from-scratch` and `production` directories containing my own implementations and production-grade implementations of the RC4 algorithms in C, respectively.

## Description of the Studies:

My RC4 cryptography studies are aimed at implementing the RC4 encryption and decryption algorithms. I will produce multiple projects to implement the algorithms and attempt to do it both from scratch and using production-grade libraries. I will be using Python and C to get familiar with the subject and implement the preliminary mathematics which undergird cryptography.

For references, I will be using the following sources:

1. Handbook of Applied Cryptography by Alfred Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, and Scott A. Vanstone
2. Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
3. Real World Cryptography by David Wong
4. Cryptography and Network Security by William Stallings

## Potential skills acquired from studies

1. Cryptographic primitives
2. Cryptographic protocols
3. Cryptographic networks
4. Python programming
5. C programming
6. Cryptographic mathematics

Overall, my RC4 cryptography studies are a great starting point for anyone looking to learn the RC4 encryption and decryption algorithms from scratch, whether you are interested in data security, blockchain, or just want to pick up a new skill.
