# Blowfish Cryptography

This is a repository for my Blowfish cryptography projects, specifically for exercises related to implementing the Blowfish encryption and decryption algorithms.

## Code Commits

I will aim to commit code weekly, time permitting, to keep track of my progress in the subject.

## Repository Structure

This directory contains all of my Blowfish cryptography projects. It is divided into two subdirectories: `blowfish_python` and `blowfish_C`, respectively. Each subdirectory contains my implementations of the Blowfish encryption and decryption algorithms in Python and C, respectively. 

### Blowfish in Python

The `blowfish_python` subdirectory contains two directories: `from-scratch` and `production`. The `from-scratch` directory contains my own attempts to implement the Blowfish encryption and decryption algorithms from scratch with the help of ChatGPT, while the `production` directory contains a production-grade implementation of the algorithms using the `cryptography` library. 

### Blowfish in C

The `blowfish_C` subdirectory is similarly structured, with `from-scratch` and `production` directories containing my own implementations and production-grade implementations of the Blowfish algorithms in C, respectively.

## Description of the Studies:

My Blowfish cryptography studies are aimed at implementing the Blowfish encryption and decryption algorithms. I will produce multiple projects to implement the algorithms and attempt to do it both from scratch and using production-grade libraries. I will be using Python and C to get familiar with the subject and implement the preliminary mathematics which undergird cryptography.

For references, I will be using the following sources:

1. Handbook of Applied Cryptography by Alfred Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, and Scott A. Vanstone
2. Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
3. Real World Cryptography by David Wong
4. Cryptography and Network Security by William Stallings

## Potential skills acquired from studies

1. Cryptographic primitives
2. Cryptographic protocols
3. Cryptographic networks
4. Python programming
5. C programming
6. Cryptographic mathematics

Overall, my Blowfish cryptography studies are a great starting point for anyone looking to learn the Blowfish encryption and decryption algorithms from scratch, whether you are interested in data security, blockchain, or just want to pick up a new skill.
