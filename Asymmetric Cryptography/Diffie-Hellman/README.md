# Diffie-Hellman Cryptography

This is a repository for my Diffie-Hellman cryptography projects, specifically for exercises related to implementing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

## Code Commits

I will aim to commit code weekly, time permitting, to keep track of my progress in the subject.

## Repository Structure

This directory contains all of my Diffie-Hellman cryptography projects. It is divided into two subdirectories: `dh_python` and `dh_C`, respectively. Each subdirectory contains my implementations of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm in Python and C, respectively. 

### Diffie-Hellman in Python

The `dh_python` subdirectory contains two directories: `from-scratch` and `production`. The `from-scratch` directory contains my own attempts to implement the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm from scratch with the help of ChatGPT, while the `production` directory contains a production-grade implementation of the algorithm using the `cryptography` library. 

### Diffie-Hellman in C

The `dh_C` subdirectory is similarly structured, with `from-scratch` and `production` directories containing my own implementations and production-grade implementations of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm in C, respectively.

## Description of the Studies:

My Diffie-Hellman cryptography studies are aimed at implementing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. I will produce multiple projects to implement the algorithm and attempt to do it both from scratch and using production-grade libraries. I will be using Python and C to get familiar with the subject and implement the preliminary mathematics which undergird cryptography.

For references, I will be using the following sources:

1. Handbook of Applied Cryptography by Alfred Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, and Scott A. Vanstone
2. Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
3. Real World Cryptography by David Wong
4. Cryptography and Network Security by William Stallings

## Potential skills acquired from studies

1. Key exchange algorithms
2. Cryptographic protocols
3. Cryptographic networks
4. Python programming
5. C programming
6. Cryptographic mathematics

Overall, my Diffie-Hellman cryptography studies are a great starting point for anyone looking to learn the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm from scratch, whether you are interested in data security, blockchain, or just want to pick up a new skill.
