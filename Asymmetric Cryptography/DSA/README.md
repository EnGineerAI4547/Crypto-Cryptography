# DSA Cryptography

This is a repository for my DSA cryptography projects, specifically for exercises related to implementing the DSA digital signature algorithm.

## Code Commits

I will aim to commit code weekly, time permitting, to keep track of my progress in the subject.

## Repository Structure

This directory contains all of my DSA cryptography projects. It is divided into two subdirectories: `dsa_python` and `dsa_C`, respectively. Each subdirectory contains my implementations of the DSA digital signature algorithm in Python and C, respectively. 

### DSA in Python

The `dsa_python` subdirectory contains two directories: `from-scratch` and `production`. The `from-scratch` directory contains my own attempts to implement the DSA digital signature algorithm from scratch with the help of ChatGPT, while the `production` directory contains a production-grade implementation of the algorithm using the `cryptography` library. 

### DSA in C

The `dsa_C` subdirectory is similarly structured, with `from-scratch` and `production` directories containing my own implementations and production-grade implementations of the DSA algorithm in C, respectively.

## Description of the Studies:

My DSA cryptography studies are aimed at implementing the DSA digital signature algorithm. I will produce multiple projects to implement the algorithm and attempt to do it both from scratch and using production-grade libraries. I will be using Python and C to get familiar with the subject and implement the preliminary mathematics which undergird cryptography.

For references, I will be using the following sources:

## Potential skills acquired from studies

1. Digital signature algorithms
2. Cryptographic protocols
3. Cryptographic networks
4. Python programming
5. C programming
6. Cryptographic mathematics

Overall, my DSA cryptography studies are a great starting point for anyone looking to learn DSA cryptography from scratch, whether you are interested in data security, blockchain, or just want to pick up a new skill.
