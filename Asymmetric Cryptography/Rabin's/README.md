# Rabin Cryptography

This is a repository for my Rabin cryptography projects, specifically for exercises related to implementing the Rabin cryptosystem.

## Code Commits

I will aim to commit code weekly, time permitting, to keep track of my progress in the subject.

## Repository Structure

This directory contains all of my Rabin cryptography projects. It is divided into two subdirectories: `rabin_python` and `rabin_C`, respectively. Each subdirectory contains my implementations of the Rabin cryptosystem in Python and C, respectively. 

### Rabin in Python

The `rabin_python` subdirectory contains two directories: `from-scratch` and `production`. The `from-scratch` directory contains my own attempts to implement the Rabin cryptosystem from scratch with the help of ChatGPT, while the `production` directory contains a production-grade implementation of the cryptosystem using the `cryptography` library. 

### Rabin in C

The `rabin_C` subdirectory is similarly structured, with `from-scratch` and `production` directories containing my own implementations and production-grade implementations of the Rabin cryptosystem in C, respectively.

## Description of the Studies:

My Rabin cryptography studies are aimed at implementing the Rabin cryptosystem. I will produce multiple projects to implement the cryptosystem and attempt to do it both from scratch and using production-grade libraries. I will be using Python and C to get familiar with the subject and implement the preliminary mathematics which undergird cryptography.

For references, I will be using the following sources:

1. Handbook of Applied Cryptography by Alfred Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, and Scott A. Vanstone
2. Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
3. Real World Cryptography by David Wong
4. Cryptography and Network Security by William Stallings

## Potential skills acquired from studies

1. Cryptographic primitives
2. Cryptographic protocols
3. Cryptographic networks
4. Python programming
5. C programming
6. Cryptographic mathematics

Overall, my Rabin cryptography studies are a great starting point for anyone looking to learn the Rabin cryptosystem from scratch, whether you are interested in data security, blockchain, or just want to pick up a new skill.
