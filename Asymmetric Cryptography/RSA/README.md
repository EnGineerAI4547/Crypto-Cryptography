# RSA Cryptography

This is a repository for my RSA cryptography projects, specifically for exercises related to implementing the RSA encryption and decryption algorithms.

## Code Commits

I will aim to commit code weekly, time permitting, to keep track of my progress in the subject.

## Repository Structure

This directory contains all of my RSA cryptography projects. It is divided into two subdirectories: `rsa_python` and `rsa_C`, respectively. Each subdirectory contains my implementations of the RSA encryption and decryption algorithms in Python and C, respectively. 

### RSA in Python

The `rsa_python` subdirectory contains two directories: `from-scratch` and `production`. The `from-scratch` directory contains my own attempts to implement the RSA encryption and decryption algorithms from scratch with the help of ChatGPT, while the `production` directory contains a production-grade implementation of the algorithms using the `cryptography` library. 

### RSA in C

The `rsa_C` subdirectory is similarly structured, with `from-scratch` and `production` directories containing my own implementations and production-grade implementations of the RSA algorithms in C, respectively.

## Description of the Studies:

My RSA cryptography studies are aimed at implementing the RSA encryption and decryption algorithms. I will produce multiple projects to implement the algorithms and attempt to do it both from scratch and using production-grade libraries. I will be using Python and C to get familiar with the subject and implement the preliminary mathematics which undergird cryptography.

For references, I will be using the following sources:
