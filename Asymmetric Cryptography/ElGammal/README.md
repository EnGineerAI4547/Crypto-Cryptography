# Cryptography Studies

This is a repository for my cryptography studies, specifically for exercises related to implementing various cryptographic primitives, protocols, and networks. 

## Code Commits

I will aim to commit code weekly, time permitting, to keep track of my progress in the subject.

## Repository Structure

This directory contains all of my El Gamal cryptography projects. It is divided into two subdirectories: `ElGammal_python` and `ElGammal_C`, respectively. Each subdirectory contains my implementations of the El Gamal encryption algorithm in Python and C, respectively. 

### El Gamal in Python

The `ElGammal_python` subdirectory contains two directories: `from-scratch` and `production`. The `from-scratch` directory contains my own attempts to implement the El Gamal encryption algorithm from scratch with the help of ChatGPT, while the `production` directory contains a production-grade implementation of the algorithm using the `cryptography` library. 

### El Gamal in C

The `ElGammal_C` subdirectory is similarly structured, with `from-scratch` and `production` directories containing my own implementations and production-grade implementations of the El Gamal algorithm in C, respectively.

## Description of the Studies:

My cryptography studies are aimed at implementing various cryptographic primitives, protocols, and networks, specifically the El Gamal encryption algorithm. I will produce multiple projects to implement the algorithm and attempt to do it both from scratch and using production-grade libraries. I will be using Python and C to get familiar with the subject and implement the preliminary mathematics which undergird cryptography. Eventually, I intend to create my own crypto project.
