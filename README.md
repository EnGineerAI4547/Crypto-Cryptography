# Cryptography Studies

This is a repository for my cryptography studies, specifically for exercises related to implementing various cryptographic primitives, protocols, and networks. 

## Code Commits

I will aim to commit code weekly, time permitting, to keep track of my progress in the subject.

## Repository Structure

The current directory contains all of the cryptography practice files related to the course. It is organized into subdirectories based on topic (e.g. "Asymmetric Cryptography", "Symmetric Cryptography", etc.) and each subdirectory will contain related projects. The structure of the repository is as follows:

cryptography-studies/  

├── Asymmetric Cryptography/  

│ ├── Project 1.py  

│ ├── Project 2.py  

│ └── ...  

├── Symmetric Cryptography/

## Description of the Studies:

My cryptography studies are aimed at implementing various cryptographic primitives, protocols, and networks. I will produce multiple crypto-based projects as well as attempt to implement popular cryptographic currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with goal of eventually creating my own crypto project. I will be using Python early on to get familiar with the subject and implement the preliminary mathematics which undergird cryptography. I will implement asymmetric cryptography, symmetric cryptography, hash functions, key exchanges, digital signatures, and other schemes as well. Eventually, I intend on doing most if not all of the same work in the C programming lanugage.

For references, I will be using the following sources:

1. [Crypto Done Right](https://cryptodoneright.org/quickstarts/dev.html)
2. Handbook of Applied Cryptography by Alfred Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, and Scott A. Vanstone
3. Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
4. Real World Cryptography by David Wong
5. Practical Cryptography in Python by Seth Nielson and Christopher Monson
6. Mastering Blockchain by Imran Bashir and Mastering Ethereum by Andreas M. Antonopoulos
7. Blockchain in Action by Bina Ramamurthy
8. YouTube channels like [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/) and [Simplilearn](https://www.youtube.com/c/Simplilearn/)

## Potential skills acquired from studies

1. Asymmetric cryptography
2. Symmetric cryptography
3. Hash functions
4. Key exchanges
5. Digital signatures
6. Cryptographic protocols
7. Cryptographic networks
8. Python programming
9. Cryptographic mathematics

Overall, my cryptography studies are a great starting point for anyone looking to learn cryptography from scratch, whether you are interested in data security, blockchain, or just want to pick up a new skill.
